About this Project
In this project, I am creating an income statement dashboard filled with relevant charts and data. Power BI dashboards are an amazing way to visualize data and make it interactive.  I began this project by importing the data and transforming it into the Power Query editor. We will then visualize the Income Statement using a table, visualize total revenue, operating income, and net income using cards, and in the final task visualize the year-on-year growth using clustered column charts. This project is for anyone who is interested in Power BI and data visualization and especially for those who work in the accounts and finance departments. By the end of this course, you will be confident in creating financial statement dashboards with many different kinds of visualizations.

This is Yearly Income Statement Table for Year-2021 & Year-2022
